- Test your code thoroughly before submitting.

## Code Formatting

### Indentation

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation.
- Avoid mixing tabs and spaces.

### Line Length

- Limit lines to **80-100 characters** when possible.

### Braces and Blocks

- Use braces for all control structures, even for single-line blocks.
  ```javascript
  // Good
  if (condition) {
      doSomething();
  }

  // Bad
  if (condition) doSomething();
