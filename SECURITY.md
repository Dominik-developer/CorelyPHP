# Security Policy

‼️ Secruity sugestions should be treated as invalid not as vulnerability.

## Secruity Policy

* Latest Releases: The newest release, currently version v1.0.0, is the only version receiving active security updates. We strongly recommend using the latest version whenever possible.

* Review Changelog for Updates: For minor updates or changes, please refer to the changelog to understand what has been updated or fixed.

* No Backports: Security fixes are applied exclusively to the latest version. Older versions will not receive retroactive patches for vulnerabilities.

* Security Risks of Unsupported Versions: Using unsupported versions exposes you to known and unknown vulnerabilities, as they are no longer maintained or updated.

* Update Regularly: Keeping your software up to date is essential to ensure your system remains secure.

## Supported Versions

<!--Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.-->

* All safe and supported versions of our software are marked with a ✅. <!-- It is highly recommended to use only these versions, as they contain the latest security fixes and improvements. Older, unsupported versions should be avoided, as they may contain vulnerabilities that will not be addressed retroactively.-->
* New versions that do not introduce changes in terms of security do not affect the lack of support for previous versions.

<!-- All versions that are safe are marked with :white_check_mark: mark. Please avoid using older versions because all security issues have been fixed in the latest releases. Solutions to these issues won’t be retrofitted to earlier versions, and support does not address past vulnerabilities. The newest release is the version that is currently supported with secruity updates.
For this moment it is v1.0.0 version. Keeping our software up to date is essential for security. Thanks!-->
