# Security Policy

‼️ Security suggestions should be treated as invalid, not as vulnerabilities.

* **Latest Releases:** The newest release, currently version v1.1.0, is the only version receiving active security updates. We strongly recommend using the latest version whenever possible.

* **Review Changelog for Updates:** For minor updates or changes, please refer to the changelog to understand what has been updated or fixed.

* **No Backports:** Security fixes are applied exclusively to the latest version. Older versions will not receive retroactive patches for vulnerabilities.

* **Security Risks of Unsupported Versions:** Using unsupported versions exposes you to known and unknown vulnerabilities, as they are no longer maintained or updated.

* **Update Regularly:** Keeping your software up to date is essential to ensure your system remains secure.

## Supported Versions

* All safe and supported versions of our software are marked with a ✅.  
* It is highly recommended to use only these versions, as they contain the latest security fixes and improvements. Older, unsupported versions should be avoided, as they may contain vulnerabilities that will not be addressed retroactively.  
* New versions that do not introduce security changes will not affect the support status of previous versions.
