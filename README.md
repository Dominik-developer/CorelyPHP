# **CorelyPHP – PHP CMS for Blogs**

**CorelyPHP** is a ready-to-deploy blogging platform with a separate admin panel for managing content.

This project is built using:  

- **`Backend:`** PHP with MySQL
- **`Frontend:`** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## **Project Structure**  

All files are divided into the following sections:  

- **`admin/`** – Contains all admin-side files
- **`articles_photos/`** - Holds photos for articles
- **`docs/`** – Holds documentation  
- **`public/`** – Contains user-facing files  

This structured approach helps prevent backend modifications while rebuilding the frontend. The only challenge is the integration of PHP functions that generate HTML dynamically, but this can be adjusted when refining queries and templates.

## **Development Status**  

I am continuously improving **CorelyPHP** to make it:  
✔ Secure  
✔ Responsive  
✔ Fully functional  
✔ Elegant  
✔ Efficient  

This project is a work in progress, and while some parts may be improved or rewritten in future updates, it is stable and ready for use. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

A more experienced developer might suggest alternative or optimized approaches. However, every lesson I’ve learned during this project will be applied to future updates and projects. I also refine the codebase whenever I find better solutions, though time constraints may limit immediate improvements.
