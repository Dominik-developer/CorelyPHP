# PHP_CMS_for_blog

This project is ready to deploy blog webiste with seprate admin panel to manage data.

It is written in PHP with MySQL on backend and HTML, CSS and JavaScript on frontend.

All files all devided into 4 groups:

* admin - with all admin side files
* docs - with documentation
* public - with all user side files  
* rest - all md files and license
  
This way of deviding files allows to not damage backend files while rebuilding fronend.
The only concern is implemetation of PHP functions and HTML code that is deliverd by functions.
But this may be easly fixed specialy that when rebuilding frontend you will want other data so queries may need some improvment or rebuild.

I am still working to make sure this project is 100% secure,, responisve, functional, elegant and the possibly the best I can make it.

Senior Dev probably will tell that few things could be build differnt or better, probably but all things I learned druring building this project will implemented in next one, plus I upgreade codebase all the time when I find easier or better way to write sometinng but I am limited by time.  

## Current version: v1.0.0

This version number means which version should be used. Release version sometimes may just have small patches that are not worth rebuilding to new V. But make sure you read what is changing so you know what is going on.
